/*
The following query gives us the details of last/latest execution of the 
SQL Server Agent Job and also the next time when the job is going to run 
(if it is scheduled). This information can also be found in the Job 
History/Job Activity Monitor windows in SSMS.

The following is a brief description of each of the fields returned from the above query:

[JobID]: A unique identifier for the SQL Server Agent job (GUID) for which the execution history is being reported.
[JobName]: Name of the SQL Server Agent job.
[LastRunDateTime]: Date and time when the job was run last time (corresponds to the most recent run).
[LastRunStatus]: Status or outcome of the last job run.
[LastRunDuration (HH:MM:SS)]: Duration of the last run represented in Hours:Minutes:Seconds format.
[LastRunStatusMessage]: More descriptive message about the job status/outcome.
[NextRunDateTime]: Date and time when the job will run next time. This information is available only for the jobs which are scheduled (a schedule is associated with a job).
