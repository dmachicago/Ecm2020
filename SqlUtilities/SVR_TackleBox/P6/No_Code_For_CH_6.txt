Hello...
You opened this document thinking that there was something here that was reminiscent to code and so were tricked.
I apologize. It was unavoidable. You would think I would not have time to add this note. You would think I should move on.
Well, thanks for opening and thanks for reading the 
SQL Server Tacklebox.  I hope you enjoy it.
