--********************************************************************************************************
--7/15/2014 17:19 min. 46,750 Rows DEV
--7/15/2014 per Mark Turner
--HAModuleDocumentID is on its way out, so is - 
--Module - RiskCategory - RiskArea - Question - Answer 
--all the "DocumentID" fields are deprecated and replaced by corresponding NodeGUID fields
--8/7/2014 - Executed in DEV with GUID changes and returned 51K Rows in 00:43:10.
--8/8/2014 - Generated corrected view in DEV
-- Verified last mod date available to EDW 9.10.2014

--09.08.2014: John Croft and I working together, realized there is a deficit in the ability 
--of the EDW to recognize changes to database records based on the last modified date of a row. 
--The views that we are currently using in the database or deeply nested. This means that 
--several base tables are involved in building a single view of data.
--
--09.30.2014: Verified with John Croft that he does want this view to return multi-languages.
--
--The views were initially designed to recognize a date change based on a record change very 
--high in the data hierarchy, the CMS Tree level which is the top most level. However, John 
--and I recognize that data can change at any level in the hierarchy and those changes must be 
--recognized as well. Currently, that is not the case. With the new modification to the views, 
--changes in CMS documents and base tables will filter up through the hierarchy and the EDW load 
--process will be able to realize that a change in this row’s data may affect and intrude into 
--the warehouse.

-- 10.01.2014 - Reviewed by Mark and Dale for use of the GUIDS
-- 10.01.2014 - Reviewed by Mark and Dale for use of Joins and fixed two that were incorrect (Thanks to Mark)

-- 10.23.2014 - (WDM) added two columns for the EDW HAPaperFlg / HATelephonicFlg
--			HAPaperFlg is whether the question was reveived electronically or on paper
--			HATelephonicFlg is whether the question was reveived by telephone or not

-- FIVE Pieces needed per John C. 10.16.2014
--	Document GUID -> HealthAssesmentUserStartedNodeGUID
--	Module GUID -> Module -> HAUserModule.HAModuleNodeGUID
--	Category GUID -> Category
--	RiskArea Node Guid -> RiskArea 
--	Question Node Guid -> Question
--	Answer Node Guid -> Answer 

 --   10.30.2014 : Sowmiya 
 --   The following are the possible values allowed in the HAStartedMode and HACompletedMode columns of the Hfit_HealthAssesmentUserStarted table
 --      Unknown = 0, 
 --       Paper = 1,  // Paper HA
 --       Telephonic = 2, // Telephonic HA
 --       Online = 3, // Online HA
 --       Ipad = 4 // iPAD
 -- 11.05.2014 - Mark T. / Dale M. needed to get the Document for the user : ADDED inner join View_HFit_HealthAssessment_Joined as VHAJ on VHAJ.DocumentID = VHCJ.HealthAssessmentID
 -- 12.02.2014 - (wdm)Found that the view was being overwritten between Prod 1 and the copy of Prod 5 / Prod 1. Found a script inside a job on PRod 5 that reverted the view to a previous state. Removed the script and the view migrates correctly (d. miller and m. kimenski)
 -- 12.02.2014 - (wdm) Found DUPS in Prod 1 and Prod 2, none in Prod 3. 
 -- 12.17.2014 - Added two columns requested by the EDW team as noted by comments next to each column.
